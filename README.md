# Chaos-Games
Chaos games describe a way of producing fractals by randomly placing dots within a polygon. Despite the random nature of the game, after a large amount of placements, fractals begin to form.

If you choose to have no extra restricitions on a triangle then if you randomly select sides and half the distance of the seed every time then you will begin to see the formation of Serpinski's Gasket/triangle. 

If you choose a square and place the retsricition that the same vertice cannot be chosen twice in a row then another beautiful fractal forms, similiarly with a pentagon. 

Currently in the UpdateSquares() i have placed the no duplicate vertices restriction, please remove the while loop if you would like to try serpinskis triangle and remember to make the numberofvertices = 3

Enjoy the chaos
